# Smart-Parking-System
A Smart Parking System simulation using ESP32, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and I2C 16x2 LCD. The sensor measures distance to detect vehicle presence and updates parking status (“Available” or “Occupied”) on the LCD. Built and tested on Wokwi, this project demonstrates IoT-based automation for smart parking solutions.
